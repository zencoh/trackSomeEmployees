## Description
This project uses MYSQL to store employees, their role, and department. I was tasked with creating a content management system. This project helps organize employees to see their managers and salaries and departments. I learned how to intigrate mysql statements with my inquirer prompts so that the users answers would corelate to a database and table along with using an update function to change a specific employee's information. The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to do the update part because I was struggling a lot with this even after reading documentation.

## Usage
This project was designed to be used from the command line, as shown in the walkthrough video first create the database you want to add to using 'SOURCE db/schema.sql' and seed the tables with basic information by typing 'SOURCE db/seeds.sql'. Then in a seperate terminal initiate the server by 'node server.js'. The user will then be prompted with the program, it is self explanitory from there. You can watch the walkthrough video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWk1UaMFxAmgUdGRGXeQVPQYuBBsOvrp/view) to aid in the process.

## Contributing
Thank you for investing your time in reading through my code and README. Since I am creating this application for a coding bootcamp I am not taking contributions at this time.

## Tests
By creating the database and seeding it in a mysql shell and initiating the server anyone can test my project for themselves.
